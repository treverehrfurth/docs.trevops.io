# Hello!

Hi, I’m **Trever Ehrfurth**. I’m currently Head of IT, with roots in engineering, consulting, and leadership. I focus on building secure, scalable systems and solving real-world infrastructure problems.

Outside of work, you’ll find me in my homelab experimenting with new technology, contributing to open-source projects, and refining automation workflows that make systems and teams more efficient.
